Description: Allows practitioners to determine (i) if two univariate distributions (which can be continuous, discrete, or even mixed) are equal, (ii) how two distributions differ (shape differences, e.g., location, scale, etc.), and (iii) where two distributions differ (at which quantiles), all using nonparametric LP statistics. The primary reference is Jungreis, D. (2019, Technical Report).
